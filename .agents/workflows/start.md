description: Mandatory protocol to load full project context at the beginning of a session
---
1. Use the `view_file` tool to read `README.md` to understand the high-level goals and tech stack.
2. Use the `view_file` tool to read `progress.log` to understand what has been completed recently.
3. Use the `view_file` tool to read `agent-notes.md` to understand the architectural rules, export logic, and user constraints.
4. Briefly acknowledge to the user that you have successfully loaded the full project context and are ready for their instructions. Do not summarize the files, just acknowledge them.
5. **Post-Task Protocol:** Always update `README.md`, `progress.log`, and `agent-notes.md` at the end of every task or session to reflect any changes, new features, or architectural decisions made.
